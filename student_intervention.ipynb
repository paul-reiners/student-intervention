    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "    - Both k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines get high F<sub>1</sub> scores on the test set (and decision trees do markedly worse).  I believe a support vector machine is the best model to use as this is a complicated domain with many features and also there should be little noise.  The training time and prediction time for support vector machines are both well under a second.\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "    - A support vector machine is a machine learning algorithm that learns from data you give it on past students and whether they passed or failed.  It does this by finding lines of separation in the feature space between students who pass and students who fail.  It works to find large margins between these two groups.  It can then make predictions on whether current students will pass or fail given data about them.\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
